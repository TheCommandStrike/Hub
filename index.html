    <h1>Game hub thingy</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    The purpose of this page is to act as a "hub" for my different GitHub repos. I might make it look a little prettier but for now it's probably going to remain a little bland.
    <br>
    <br>
    Bolded text will usually be a link.
    <br>
    <br>
    Note that some of these are forks of Github repos that I don't own, and you can find all of the original creators by going to <a href="github.com/thecommandstrike">github.com/thecommandstrike</a> and below the name of each github repo you can see the original it was forked from.
    <br>
    <br>
    In case you didnt know you can shift click a link to open in a new tab if you wanna keep this one open.
    <br>

    If you wanna get in contact with me for whatever reason you can email me at TheCommandStrike@gmail.com, message me on discord (TheCommandStrike), or talk to me in school if you know me in person. Keep in mind that I rarely check my email and you might have a hard time reaching me there. If you message me on discord I'll be much more likely to respond.
