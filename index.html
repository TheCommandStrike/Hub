    <h1>Game hub thingy</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    The purpose of this page is to act as a "hub" for my different GitHub repos.
    <br>
    <br>
    Note that some of these are forks of Github repos that I don't own, and you can find all of the original creators by going to <a href="github.com/thecommandstrike">github.com/thecommandstrike</a> and below the name of each github repo you can see the original it was forked from.
    <br>
    <br>
    In case you didnt know you can shift click a link to open in a new tab if you wanna keep this one open.
